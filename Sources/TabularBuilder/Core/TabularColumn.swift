import TabularData

/// A generic structure that defines a table column corresponding to a specific property of a
/// persistent object.
///
/// `TabularColumn` represents a column in a tabular data structure, mapping values from a source
/// object to a specific output format. It supports various transformation scenarios including
/// simple
/// mapping, conditional mapping, and column creation conditions.
///
/// ## Generic Parameters
///
/// - `ObjectType`: The type of the source object containing the data
/// - `ValueType`: The type of the property being extracted from the object
/// - `OutputType`: The type of the final output after transformation
///
/// ## Usage Examples
///
/// ```swift
/// // Simple column mapping (type transformation)
/// let ageColumn = TabularColumn(
///     name: "Age",
///     keyPath: \.age,
///     mapping: { age in "\(age) years old" }  // Int -> String
/// )
///
/// // Conditional column (advanced mapping with branching)
/// let statusColumn = TabularColumn.conditional(
///     name: "Status",
///     keyPath: \.score,
///     filter: { student in student.score > 60 },
///     then: { score in "Pass: \(score)" },      // score > 60
///     else: { score in "Fail: \(score)" }       // score <= 60
/// )
///
/// // When column (conditional column creation)
/// let premiumColumn = TabularColumn(name: "Premium Features", keyPath: \.features)
///     .when { $0.isPremium }  // Only create this column for premium user groups
/// ```
public struct TabularColumn<ObjectType, ValueType, OutputType> {
    /// The name of the column as it will appear in the table.
    public let name: String

    /// The key path to the property in the source object.
    public let keyPath: KeyPath<ObjectType, ValueType>

    /// The mapping function that transforms the extracted value to the output type.
    ///
    /// This function is responsible for type transformation, converting `ValueType` to
    /// `OutputType`.
    /// Common use cases include formatting numbers to strings, converting raw values to display
    /// text,
    /// or transforming data structures.
    ///
    /// Example: `{ age in "\(age) years old" }` transforms Int to String.
    public let mapping: (ValueType) -> OutputType

    /// Optional conditional mapping function that provides advanced branching logic.
    ///
    /// This is a powerful extension of `mapping` that allows different transformations based on
    /// the entire object's state, not just the target property value. Unlike `mapping` which only
    /// has access to the extracted property value, conditional mapping can examine other properties
    /// of the object to determine how to transform the current value.
    ///
    /// **Key difference from mapping**: `mapping` can only transform based on the property value
    /// itself,
    /// while `conditionalMapping` can make decisions based on the entire object context.
    ///
    /// Example scenarios where `mapping` alone cannot work:
    /// - Display user age differently based on VIP status: VIPs get "25 years (VIP)", others get
    /// "25"
    /// - Show sensitive data based on user permissions: admins see full data, users see masked data
    /// - Format values differently based on object category or type
    ///
    /// The first parameter indicates whether the object passed the filter condition.
    public var conditionalMapping: ((Bool, ValueType) -> OutputType)?

    /// Optional filter function that determines the branch for conditional mapping.
    ///
    /// This function is applied to each object to determine which branch of the
    /// conditional mapping should be used. Works in conjunction with `conditionalMapping`.
    public var filter: ((ObjectType) -> Bool)?

    /// Condition that determines whether this column should be created for a given data group.
    ///
    /// **Important**: Only the first object in the array is checked against this condition.
    /// This design allows the same builder declaration to be applied to different data groups
    /// by pre-categorizing the data. If the condition returns `false`, the column will not be
    /// created.
    ///
    /// Use case: Create different column sets for different user types by grouping users first,
    /// then applying the same builder to each group.

    /// - When the transformation needs to consider other object properties
    /// - When the same property value should be displayed differently based on object state

    ///     keyPath: \.age,
    ///     filter: { user in user.isVIP },
